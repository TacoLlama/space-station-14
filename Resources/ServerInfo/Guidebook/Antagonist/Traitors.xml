  Traitors are antagonists employed by the [color=#ff0000]Syndicate.[/color] You are a sleeper agent who has access to various tools and weapons through your [bold]uplink[/bold].
  You also receive [bold]codewords[/bold] to identify other agents, and a coordinated team of traitors can have [italic]brutal results.[/italic]

  Anyone besides [textlink="department heads" link="Command"] or members of [textlink="Security" link="Security"] can be a traitor.

  ## Uplink & Activation
  The [color=cyan]uplink[/color] is your most important tool as a traitor. You can exchange the 20 [color=red]telecrystals[/color] (TC) you start with for items that will help you with your objectives.

  By pressing [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenCharacterMenu"][/bold][/color], you'll see your personal uplink code. [bold]Setting your PDA's ringtone as this code will open the uplink.[/bold]
  Pressing [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenCharacterMenu"][/bold][/color] also lets you view your objectives and the codewords.

  If you do not have a PDA when you are activated, an [color=cyan]uplink implant[/color] is provided [bold]for the full [color=red]TC[/color] price of the implant.[/bold]
  It can be accessed from your hotbar.

  </Box>

  [bold]Make sure to close your PDA uplink to prevent anyone else from seeing it.[/bold] You don't want [color=#cb0000]Security[/color] to notice you have it and confiscate it from you!

  Implanted uplinks are not normally accessible to other people, so they do not have any security measures. They can, however, be removed from you with an empty implanter.

  The purchases that you make should be to help you with your objectives. Some gear may not be of use to you, and you'll have to choose between being sneaky or going loud.

  ## Coordination
  Codewords are words or phrases that every traitor will know. They provide a discreet way to identify or establish contact with a fellow traitor, which can be useful if your objectives include [italic][color=cyan]helping them with their objectives.[/color][/italic]

  When you find some friends, [bold]you can withdraw [color=red]telecrystals[/color] from your uplink to give to them.[/bold] They can put these in their own uplink to spend for themselves.

  Some offers available on your uplink require more than 20 TC to purchase, so if you want them you'll have to share.

  ## Assassination
  One of your objectives may be to [italic][color=cyan]kill or maroon a crewmember.[/color][/italic]

  You can [color=cyan]maroon[/color] your target by [bold]preventing them from reaching CentComm[/bold] via the evacuation shuttle or an escape pod.

  If you can't maroon your target or they're too important to leave alive, you'll have to get your hands dirty and [color=cyan]murder[/color] them. Make sure your target is not alive when the [bold]evacuation shuttle gets to CentComm,[/bold] and don't let them be resuscitated.

  Remember, the Syndicate want only your targets dead. [color=red]Try to avoid mass murder or major damage to the station,[/color] as the more innocent lives you take, the more of a liability you become.

  ## Evasion & Self-Termination
  Your objectives may require you to [italic][color=cyan]make it to CentComm without being killed or captured.[/color][/italic] Don't let [color=#cb0000]Security[/color] stop you, complete your other objectives and [bold]come back alive.[/bold]

  Alternatively, your objectives may require you to [italic][color=cyan]die a glorious death.[/color][/italic] [bold]Make sure you don't come back from the dead,[/bold] or else you may wake up in cuffs.
  
  DAGD allows a lot of things that are normally banned, but you can never loose the Tesla. If you aren't sure if what you want to do is allowed, Ahelp it!

  ## Appropriation
  More often than not, you'll have to [italic][color=cyan]steal a possession of a department head.[/color][/italic]

  The target may be in their office, or on their person. It may become necessary to kill whoever is carrying it, if you cannot pickpocket them.

  Some of the things you may be tasked with include:
  - Stealing the [color=yellow]Captain[/color]'s [bold]ID Card[/bold], [bold]antique laser pistol[/bold], [bold]jetpack[/bold], or [bold]nuclear authentication disk[/bold].

  ## Roleplay and Story Objectives
  There are a number of ways to do your job as an antagonist, but some objectives are much more open ended than others. [bold]Story Objectives[/bold] are objectives that are designed to be more free-form and encourage you to complete them however you see fit. They are also often things that would be hard or impossible to track mechanically.
  
  Because of this, all Story Objectives require you to [italic][color=cyan]make it to CentComm without being killed or captured.[/color][/italic]
  
  All Story Objectives are denoted by a bold green  [bold][color=green]'RP'[/bold][/color]  icon
  
  Story Objectives may ask you to:
  - Recover captured Contraband from the Armory in [color=#cb0000]Security[/color]. Security often gathers a large amount of Contraband that they lock in the Armory, much of it being Syndicate in origin. Deprive the enemy of material, and recover it.
  - Interrogate the [color=#1f78ff]NanoTrasen Representative[/color] and other Department Heads for [color=#9819ff]Corporate Secrets[/color]. A very risky objective, making using of disguises and Security gear to detain may be needed. Remember to turn off their coordinates or take them off-station to prevent trackers from finding them.
  - Challenge people to duels, to the death or otherwise. Remember you need to escape to Central Command still, so murder isn't advised- unless you use this as a guise to get to a kill target that is. Consensual duels are the best excuse.
  - Many many more!

  
  [bold]A few more tips:[/bold]
  - What makes fun roleplay always reigns supreme.
  - If you aren't sure if you would be allowed to do something, Ahelp it. Admins will usually allow things that border on or even cross the line, if its done in an MRP way that makes good Roleplay!
  - You can [bold]EMAG[/bold] any Fax Machine to unlock the Syndicate Fax. If you need to pass information on to the Syndicate for an objective but won't make it out alive, this can be an alternative way to do that.
  - Other antagonists aren't always trustworthy, even fellow Traitors. They could be assigned to kill [bold]you[/bold].
