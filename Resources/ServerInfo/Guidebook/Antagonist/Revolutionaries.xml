  Revolutionaries are conversion antagonists hired by the [color=yellow]Union of Soviet Socialist Planets[/color], who are tasked with taking control over any of the stations, including [color=#5346e0]yours[/color].

  ## Objectives
  You must convert, cuff or kill all of the [textlink="Command staff" link="Command"] on station in no particular order.

  Your objective is [bold]not to destroy the station[/bold], but [italic]to take it over[/italic], so try to minimize damage where possible.

  [bold]The revolution will fail[/bold] if all of the [bold][color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionaries[/color][/bold] die, and all [color=red]Revolutionaries[/color] will de-convert if this happens.

  ## Headrevs & Conversion
  [bold][color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionaries[/color][/bold] are chosen at the start of the shift and begin with a [color=cyan]flash[/color], a pair of [color=cyan]sunglasses[/color], and an [color=#ed7300]SKB uplink implanter[/color].

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="Flash"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingEyesGlassesSunglasses"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="USSPUplinkImplanter"/>
  </Box>

  You can convert crew members to your side by taking any [bold]flash[/bold] and attacking someone with it using [color=#ff0000]harm mode[/color].
  However, [bold]you can't convert your target if they're wearing [color=cyan]flash protection[/color][/bold] such as sunglasses, welding mask/goggles, or if they're a character with blind trait.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingHeadHatWelding"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="ClothingEyesWeldingGoggles"/>
  </Box>

  [bold][color=red]Revolutionaries[/color] can't convert people themselves,[/bold] but they're more than capable of doing dirty work, carrying out orders, or distribute supplies if [bold]they were implanted with [color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionary's SKB uplink.[/color][/bold]

  ## MindShields™

  Another obstacle in your way are those pesky brainwashing [color=cyan]MindShield™ implanters[/color]. 

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="MindShieldImplanter"/>
  </Box>

  These will:
  - Prevent the implanted person from being converted into a [color=red]Revolutionary[/color]
  - De-convert Revolutionaries, and will make them no longer loyal to your cause
  - [bold]Visibly be destroyed upon being implanted into a [color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionary[/color][/bold], giving you away
  - NOT protect against flash disorientation

  Assume all of [color=#cb0000]Security[/color], [color=#1b67a5]Command[/color] and [color=#a86819]Salvage specialists[/color] to be implanted with [color=cyan]MindShields™[/color] already, [bold]however they can be removed using an empty implanter, obtainable from the Medical department's MedFab, or in your [color=#ed7300]uplink.[/color][/bold]

  ## Svyaz-UZL uplink (Telebonds & Total Conversion)

  [color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionaries[/color] start additionally with an [color=#ed7300]SKB uplink implanter[/color], which can be implanted into them or in a [color=red]Revolutionary[/color] [bold]converted by them specifically.[/bold]

  <Box>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="USSPUplinkImplanter"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="BaseRevUplinkRadio"/>
  </Box>

  The subdermal uplink allows purchase of various [bold]global limited stocks[/bold] of weapons and tools for the revolution via [bold][color=#5c5c5c]Telebonds[/color][/bold] and [bold][color=#e3a736]Total Conversion.[/color][/bold]

  - [bold][color=#5c5c5c]Telebonds[/color][/bold], much like [color=red]Telecrystals[/color] are a individual private currency obtainable from [bold]conversion[/bold], that are each specific to each [color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionary[/color].
  - [bold][color=#e3a736]Total Conversion[/color][/bold], apart from showing how many crew members have been converted, is a [bold]score shared among all [color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionaries[/color][/bold]. Which are mainly used in the [bold]GLOBAL[/bold] section of the uplink, allowing you to place things like the [color=yellow]supply rift[/color].

  When a [bold][color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionary[/color][/bold] converts someone, they gain [bold][color=#5c5c5c]1 Telebond[/color][/bold] privately, and [bold][color=#e3a736]1 Total Conversion[/color][/bold] globally.
  
  Remember, [bold][color=#e3a736]Total Conversion[/color][/bold] is a [bold]global progress score, not a currency[/bold], allowing you to gain items for free as soon as you reach certain conversions.

  The uplink stocks are shared among all who use the uplink, and additionally it shows who has last purchased the item.

  </Box>

  ## Supply Rift

  Upon reaching [bold]20 total conversions[/bold], you will be able to place a [color=yellow]supply rift[/color], which will drop soviet supplies every 35 seconds.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CrateSovietArmaments" Caption="500 crates"/>
    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="WeaponSniperMosin" Caption="Mass Assault"/>
  </Box>

  The [color=yellow]rift[/color] will [bold]secretly inform all [color=red]revolutionaries[/color] in the chat of it's location[/bold] upon spawn.

  At 50% charge, the station [bold]will be alerted of an energy influx[/bold], thus [bold]exposing you[/bold] at the cost of infinite supplies in the long run.

  If a [color=yellow]rift[/color] is destroyed, you won't be able to place another one. And you'll only be able to place another if the [bold]current one is charged.[/bold]

  It is recommended to discuss early on in the round where you'll place the [color=yellow]rift[/color] with your [color=red]revolutionaries[/color] so that they can [bold]fortify[/bold] the area to prevent [color=#cb0000]Security[/color] from [bold]destroying[/bold] it.

  ## Tips

  As a [color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionary[/color], it's recommended that:
  - You [bold]convert[/bold] people away from public spaces. Apart from being potentially seen by the [color=#70a7ff]Station AI[/color], flash and knockdowns are loud and it can be heard by anyone not loyal to you. Out of public conversions are best done by a [color=blue]Paramedic[/color].

  </Box>

  - It's very beneficial to start as one or convert [color=#f5be51]Cargo/Mail Technicians[/color] and [color=#a319ff]Scientists[/color], due to their sufficient ability to [bold]stop incoming orders of [color=cyan]MindShields™[/color][/bold] or to [bold]provide you with flashes made from an [color=blue]Exosuit Fabricator[/color][/bold], respectively.

  </Box>

  - Be careful who you're trying to convert. Early on in the round some crew like [color=green]Musicians[/color] or [color=green]Bartenders[/color] wear [bold]sunglasses[/bold]. While [color=#a86819]Salvage specialists[/color] are outright [color=cyan]MindShielded™[/color].

  </Box>

  - If you're in for a long run, convert [color=#2189ff]Medical[/color] personnel. Long revolutionary rounds will inevitably mean lots of losses. Competent doctors will prioritize your health and of your allies over those from [color=#cb0000]Security[/color] or [color=#1b67a5]Command[/color], if by any chance they're getting treated in [color=#2189ff]Medbay[/color] rather than in [color=#cb0000]Brigmedic's medical bay[/color].

  - [bold][color=#5c5c5c]Telebonds[/color][/bold] can be withdrawn and shared among all who use the [color=#ed7300]uplink[/color]. As such, if you want to purchase [bold]one of the more expensive items[/bold], it's best to meet with your [color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionaries[/color] later on in the round if no prior [bold][color=#5c5c5c]Telebonds[/color][/bold] purchases were made.

  As a [color=red]Revolutionary[/color], it's recommended that:

  - You protect your [color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionary[/color] at all costs. Protect them from [color=red]the law[/color], by trading IDs and goods so that they can make their escapes.

    <GuideEntityEmbed Entity="CargoIDCard" Caption="Potentially Wanted ID"/>
  </Box>

  - If a [color=yellow]supply rift[/color] was placed, you [bold]will be secretly informed of it's location[/bold]. So do your best and provide help when possible.

  - If you know where the [color=#ed7300]Head Revolutionaries[/color] will place the [color=yellow]rift[/color] beforehand, you can help reinforcing the area.

  </Box>

  - And lastly, have fun. As long as it helps the revolution without severly damaging the station.
