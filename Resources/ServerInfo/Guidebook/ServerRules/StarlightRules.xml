  # Server Rules
The following rules are for the Starlight Space Station 14 servers. Violating these rules may result in a warning, a temporary ban, or a permanent ban. You may also be banned from specific roles/jobs/departments. Bans can be appealed in the official Starlight Discord server.

Players are also expected to understand Metashield. All rules and the metashield are often more up to date on the starlight wiki.

If you are ever in doubt as to whether or not something is breaking the rules, feel free to contact the admins via Admin Help or ask on the Discord server.

For in-universe laws and rules check Corporate Law and SOP.

Remember, the rules and examples given here are NOT exhaustive. (See Rule 1)

The servers are strictly [bold]16+ only[/bold].

Deathmatch and sandbox gamemodes may not have these rules apply, rules will be given if they are changed. Ghost chat is an out of character in game chat, and does not need to apply to MRP rules.

## Core Rules
  These rules apply at all times, including between rounds.
