  # Rule 13 - Command Member and Whitelist Expectations.
Players in Command roles and Whitelisted positions are held to a higher standard of roleplay and are expected to act professionally and responsibly. Both groups must follow their Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to ensure the integrity of their roles.

Misuse of command or whitelisted roles may result in a roleban, with repeated offenses leading to a server ban or a permanent ban from command and whitelist positions.

This applies especially to Magistrates and NanoTrasen Representatives, who must uphold their duties with integrity. Willfully violating SOP, abusing power, or lying to Central Command may result in a permanent ban from these roles.

## Expectations for Command and Whitelisted Players
- Command members must follow their assigned SOP, ensuring fair leadership and proper department management.
- Whitelisted players are required to adhere to SOPs, maintaining the integrity of specialized roles and demonstrating strong roleplay skills.
- Proper attire should be worn at all timesâ€”command and whitelisted roles should be dressed appropriately for their positions.

## Examples of Punishable Actions:
- Head of Personnel granting All Access to all passengers, violating SOP guidelines.
- Overly abusive department heads mistreating subordinates or disregarding SOP duties.
- Complete neglect of SOPs, acting outside the expected responsibilities of the role.
- General LRP behavior or violating Rule 3 regarding MRP logic.
