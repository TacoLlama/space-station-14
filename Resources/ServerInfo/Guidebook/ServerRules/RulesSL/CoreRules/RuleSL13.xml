  # Rule 13 - Command, Security, and Whitelist Expectations.
Players in Command or Securty roles and Whitelisted positions are held to a higher standard of roleplay and are expected to act professionally and responsibly. In these positions your character must follow their Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to ensure the integrity of their roles.

Misuse of command or whitelisted roles may result in a roleban, with repeated offenses leading to a server ban or a permanent ban from command and whitelist positions.

This applies especially to Magistrates and NanoTrasen Representatives, who must uphold their duties with integrity. Willfully violating SOP, abusing power, or lying to Central Command may result in a permanent ban from these roles.

## Expectations
- Command positions are required to adhere to SOP, ensuring fair leadership and proper department management.
- Security positions are required to adhere to SOP and properly enforce Corporate Law, ensuring fair treatment of criminals and an enjoyable player experience.
- Whitelisted positions are required to adhere to SOP, maintaining the integrity of specialized roles and demonstrating strong roleplay skills.
- Proper attire should be worn at all timesâ€”command, security, and whitelisted roles should be dressed appropriately for their positions.

## Examples of Punishable Actions:
- Head of Personnel granting All Access unnecessarily, violating SOP guidelines.
- Overly abusive department heads mistreating subordinates or disregarding SOP duties.
- Warden giving a cooperative criminal a maximum sentence on the first offense.
- Complete neglect of SOPs, acting outside the expected responsibilities of the role.
- General LRP behavior or violating Rule 3 regarding MRP logic.

## Cadet Exemption
- Security Cadets are still learning and so are exempt from this expectation.
