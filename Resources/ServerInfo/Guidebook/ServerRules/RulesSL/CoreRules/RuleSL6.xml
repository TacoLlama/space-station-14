 # Rule 6 – Your Character Must Make Sense
Your character is an employee of the space station, hired by Central Command, and should behave accordingly. All characters must act as if they are 18+, maintaining a professional and immersive roleplay experience.

## Character Identity & Naming Rules
- Names and surnames must align with the context and standards of the setting.
- Celebrity names, fictional characters, and out-of-character names are not allowed (e.g., "JC Denton," "George Washington," "Spongebob Squarepants," "Billie Eilish").
- Your character should act appropriately for their role and should not behave erratically or neglect responsibilities.
- Your character cannot intentionally duplicate the name and likeness of another player’s character.
- Names cannot include calls for violence, or anything that violates Rule 0.

## Exceptions
- Silicon, Clown, and Mime names are allowed to contain references. Politically charged and vulgar reference names are not allowed.
- Nicknames are allowed within apostrophes, and should be appropriate for a corporate environment. Nicknames may contain indirect references. The format for nicknames depends on species, but in general follows one of these formats:
\n - [color=000000] Givename 'Nickname' Surname[/color]
\n - [color=000000] 'Nickname' Surname[/color]
\n - [color=000000] Givenname 'Nickname'[/color]

## Roleplay & Behavioral Expectations
- Real-world topics, such as current events and real-life politics, should not be discussed.
- Players should fulfill their assigned duties—for example, security should not randomly distribute weapons.
- Neglecting your job, such as repeatedly ignoring duties to get drunk at the bar despite urgent requests, breaks immersion and may result in disciplinary action.
