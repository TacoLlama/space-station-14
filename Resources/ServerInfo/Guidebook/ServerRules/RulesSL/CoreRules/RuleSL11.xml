 # Rule 11 - New Life.
 The New Life system allows players to rejoin the round as a new character after death. However, this feature comes with roleplay restrictions to maintain fairness and immersion.

Upon respawning as a new character, you forget everything you knew as your past character or ghost. 
This means:
- You may not seek out your previous body, return to your prior workplace, or attempt to reclaim any possessions you previously owned.
- You may not interact with the players who were responsible for your previous characterâ€™s death. Any conflicts or grudges from your past life must not carry over.
- You may not reference past events in any way. Your new character has no memory of them.

## New Life Abuse examples:
- Spamming new characters to re-enter the round repeatedly.
- Using New Life to intentionally roll for antagonist slots.
- Using New Life to avoid in-character consequences, like a security sentence.
- Using a new character to get revenge on a player who harmed you.
