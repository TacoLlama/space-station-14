  # Rule 12 - Silicons and Thaven Must Follow Their Laws and Moods
- [bold]Silicons[/bold] and [bold]Thaven[/bold] are bound to their Laws and Moods respectively. They are expected to adhere to the following standards when following them.

- Laws and moods override all other gameplay and roleplay rules. If your laws or moods explicitly require you to break server rules, you must.
\n - [color=000000]Absence of a relevant law/mood is not an excuse to break server rules. If you don't have a law/mood that supersedes server rules, the server rules still apply.
\n - [color=000000]A vague law/mood does not normally let you break server rules. Ahelp first if you are confused, or have an interpretation that would let you break server rules.
- Follow laws in order, with the lowest numbered/top (or glitched) rule taking priority over the ones beneath it.
- You cannot request a law change, or willingly allow an unauthorized law change.
\n - [color=000000]Authorized law changes are to be allowed as long as consistent with your laws.
\n - [color=000000]Authorized law changes can be found in the Command SOP.
\n - [color=000000]Lethal force may be used in the case of unauthorized law changes.
- You must remain consistent with your interpretation of your laws/moods.
- Crew ID determines who/what is defined as crew. Any appropriate job icon is to be considered crew.
\n - [color=000000]Zombies/Antags/Nuclear Operatives with proper ID are to be considered crew.
\n - [color=000000][bold]Visitors are not crew[/bold] until they have been hired by HoP. [The V icon]
- Crew harm refers to physical harm, prioritized by immediacy and likelihood.
- You may ignore crew orders that are unreasonable, such as asking a silicon to round remove themselves without a good reason.
