  # Rule 14 - Continuity Guidelines
Some information, continuity, and memory is carried between rounds on Starlight, within set limits. This is accomplished in universe by the PSO Cloning System, and comes with some limits and rules to ensure smooth roleplay and minimal disruption.

You can only remember information from shifts that you survive. This means if you are stranded or killed, you forget the shift completely. If your body is revivable when it reaches CentComm, you also remember the shift but you forget all of the details leading up to your death per Rule 3.

[bold]Any information that is [textlink="Metashielded" link="Metashield"] is forgotten between shifts, and is wiped from your clone's memory.

IE: A Captain who survives a Revolution will still have information about the Revolution wiped, and won't remember it happening that shift.

You may remember that crimes occurred, but you will never remember who committed them. This includes if you yourself were a Syndicate Agent.

Examples of things you [bold]can[/bold] remember:
- Social interactions with another character, such as getting drinks at the bar or even getting into an argument
- Which jobs characters usually work- though this may not be used to meta that something is 'up' if someone isn't working their usual job
- The layout of the station, though some leeway should be given for forgetting secret rooms- maints are an ever changing maze even if they look the same every shift for OOC reasons

Examples of things you [bold]can't[/bold] remember:

- Joe the Botanist was a Syndicate who stole the Captain's Jetpack
- Nuclear Operatives attacking the station
- CentComm calling Code Epsilon and killing a bunch of people on the station
- Witnessing a Hollow body or seeing a Changeling eat someone
- As NanoTrasen Representative, remembering that last shift had Nuclear Operatives
