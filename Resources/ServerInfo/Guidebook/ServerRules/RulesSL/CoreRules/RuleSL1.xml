# Rule 1 - Respect Admin decisions

Above all else, if an admin is telling you to stop doing something, stop doing it. You may explain your point of view and your reasoning, however you must still follow what the admin requests you do, even if you disagree. If you believe that a punishment, ruling, or other admin action was incorrect or unjust, you may appeal it on the discord server through a ticket. If you want to do something but are unsure of whether it is allowed in the rules, please ask via ahelp first.

Also, please remember: Admins are neither omniscient nor omnipresent: while they have a large arsenal of tools at their disposal to stop rule breakers, they usually aren't able to stop something before it happens. Please use the Ahelp feature (F1) to report any rule breaking! Even if it's just a gut suspicion, it's fine to use this feature to request an investigation.


Example(s) of this rule being broken:

- "There isn't a rule saying I can't!"
- "None of the other players had a problem with it!"
- "No one had a problem with it last time!"
