 # Rule 5 – Antagonists Must Follow MRP Logic
 Antagonistic actions should only be made to achieve an antagonist goal. [color=red]Failure to do so may be considered a breach of MRP logic and result in punishment.[/color] Team antagonists must work with their team, and follow the orders of their leaders where possible (Revolutionaries, Terror spiders, etc…).

Antagonists are required to follow escalation rules when not dealing with their target, but should attempt to remain hidden and undiscovered throughout the shift if they have the “Escape to CentComm alive and unrestrained.” objective or similar objectives.

Should an antagonist have been discovered by accident or by admission of another antagonist, they are not required to remain hidden any longer, however they should not use this as an excuse to mass RDM, or break other server rules. (Consider using a stealthy approach to escape.)

Antagonists that may play openly from the start of the round, and are not required to escalate their actions are listed below. These antagonists should not deviate from their objectives to murder everyone on station,[bold] but should follow their objectives: [/bold]
- Space Dragon
- Nuclear Operatives/Lone Operatives
- Abductors
- Wizard
- Rat King
- Space Ninja
- Revolutionaries (after gaining sufficient strength to overthrow the station)

Shuttle bombing or mass sabotage is forbidden. However, antagonists may attempt to complete their objectives on the Evac shuttle, and once the end round screen has appeared, must cease all antagonist activity and attempt to escape or blend in with the crew.

## Zombies
Initial Infected are allowed to sabatoge the station as long as they follow all server rules. However, once you are a zombie:
- You may only destroy the station to reach living organisms you can see or hear.
- You may not attack lights or power sources.
