 # Rule 2 – No Griefing, Bug Abuse, or Exploits
 Intentionally ruining gameplay for others is prohibited. Round-ending or highly disruptive actions, such as:

- Releasing the Tesla/Singularity
- Large-scale station destruction (department-size or larger)
- RDM (Random Death Match)
- Intentionally Plasma or Tritium flooding the station
- May result in a permanent ban. Some objectives or circumstances may allow exceptions—when in doubt, ask an admin before proceeding.

Additionally, using bugs/exploits to gain an unfair advantage is prohibited. Please report them via ahelp or in the Discord.

## AFK Farming & Antag Rolling
AFK farming time for Role Requirements is prohibited—players must actively engage and contribute to the game.
Ghosting, suicide, or otherwise leaving the game after failing to get an antagonist role is considered “Antag Rolling” and is not permitted.
