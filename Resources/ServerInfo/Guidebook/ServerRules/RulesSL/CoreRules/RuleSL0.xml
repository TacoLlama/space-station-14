 # Rule 0 - Be Respectful
Use your best judgment to ensure a fun, fair, and welcoming environment. Keep all arguments In Character and avoid heated discussions in LOOC, ahelps, or the lobby. Out-of-character communication should always remain respectful and kind.

Harassment or toxic behavior, includes but is not limited to:

- Racism, sexism, discrimination
- Excessive talk/glorification of self-harm
- Talking about Real Life politics
- Targeting the same player across rounds
- Insulting other players in OOC/LOOC
- Will not be tolerated and may result in a permanent ban.

Mhelp (Mentor Help) lets players ask game mechanics questions without revealing information to others, mainly antagonists. It should only be used when the answer isn't available through IC (in character) or OOC/LOOC (out of character) means and should not be the first option.

Ahelp (Admin Help) facilitates communication between players and admins for admin intervention, rule clarification, or addressing game-breaking bugs (all bugs should be reported in Discord). It is not for venting, complaints, or general round commentary. Ignoring admin messages or disconnecting during an Ahelp may have consequences.
