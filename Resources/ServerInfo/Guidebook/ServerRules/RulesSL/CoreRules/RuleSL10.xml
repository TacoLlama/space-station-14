 # Rule 10 â€“ Erotic Roleplay (ERP) is Forbidden.
 Erotic Roleplay (ERP) is strictly prohibited. This includes any roleplay involving descriptions, mentions, or enactments of sexual acts, whether through text, images, or any other form of content.

Shifts should not revolve around romantic relationships or dating between characters. While basic interactions such as hugging is allowed, descriptions must remain non-graphic and non-extreme. Romantic relationships should not become the focus of the game for you or anyone else.

## Clarifications on Acceptable Language
In-character insults are not considered ERP, as long as they do not become excessive or extreme. 

Some examples of acceptable insults:
- "Fuck you" - insult
- "What a motherfucker" - insult
- "How about you eat me instead" - Response to an unreasonable request. 


It is best to avoid borderline content, ensuring roleplay remains appropriate within the established guidelines.
