1. Cargo Technicians report directly to the Quartermaster.

2. Cargo Technicians are responsible for the handling of orders and retrieval from the ATS once an order is approved. Orders must not be delayed to being on station more than 10 minutes after approval. Delays longer than this, without sufficient cause, can be considered negligence or incompetence.

3. Crates that are part of an order should not be opened. Instead their label should be checked for questions about their contents and the requestor.

4. Secure crates should not be opened by force. An exception is made if ordered to do so by the head of the relevant department or captain during an emergency.

5. Issues with policy or employment should be directed to the Quartermaster or the Head of Personnel. Any mention of "Cargonia" will be met with contract termination.
