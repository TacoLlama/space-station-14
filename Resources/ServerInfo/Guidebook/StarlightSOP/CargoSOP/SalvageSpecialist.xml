1. You report directly to the Quartermaster and should communicate with the Quartermaster before and after each expedition with a verbal status report. After every 2 expeditions or if the salvage crew must return sooner, a formal docking procedure must be completed.

This procedure is as follows:
- The salvage team will notify the Quartermaster of their intent to return to the station.
- Any contraband found is to be turned over to security. Contraband request forms may be filled out for these items.
- Any salvage materials found should be given over for processing.
- Any damage to the ship/crew must be reported and repaired.

2. Highly dangerous expeditions may only be undertaken with the express permission of the Quartermaster. Going on unauthorized expeditions is grounds for demotion.

3. Contraband found while on an expedition may not be used. Exceptions for imminent loss of life or grievous bodily harm are accepted.

4. Upon arrival to the station, all contraband must be delivered to the security department immediately.

6. Salvage Specialists are to follow the guidelines for Cargo Technicians when on station. 

7. Machinery may not be moved from the station to the shuttle unless there are duplicates available on station. Equipment like ore processors and the salvage ticket machine are for use by both Salvage Specialists and Mining Specialists, removal impedes Mining Specialists duties.
