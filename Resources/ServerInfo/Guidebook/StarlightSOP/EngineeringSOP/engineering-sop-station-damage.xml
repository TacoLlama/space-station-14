    1. Damage to the Bridge, Evac, Arrivals, and Secure Areas should be prioritized for repairs. Following these areas is the Medical and Security departments.

    2. Should repairs be required with no appropriate personnel around, engineering personnel may hack doors to repair the area. These doors must be returned to their original condition once repairs are complete.

    3. Should no station damage be present, Engineers may take on solo projects, reconstructions, or shuttle building.

    4. Security should be contacted to establish a perimeter around especially damaged areas of the station.
