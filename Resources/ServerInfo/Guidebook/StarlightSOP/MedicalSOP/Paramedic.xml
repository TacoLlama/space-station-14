1. Paramedics report directly to the Chief Medical Officer.

2. Paramedics should stabilize crew members who are in critical condition before moving them to medbay.

3. Crew members who are deceased are to be placed into a body bag before transport to medbay.

4. Paramedics are permitted to carry one defibrillator on their person, as long as at least one remains in the medbay.

5. Should a crewmember not be able to be stabilized in the field (excess damage, no means to heal) or defibrillated, they should inform medbay using radio communications prior to arrival.

6. Paramedics should carry sufficient supplies for each major damage type (burn, brute, poison, airloss, and bloodloss, and radiation).
