# Parole

1. A criminal is sentenced to parole.

Criminals may be sentenced to parole if:

- They request parole before or during their sentence and Warden or Head of Security approves. The request should always be approved if a prisoner has been cooperative during their incarceration and served at least half their sentence. All other situations are up to discretion.
- A member of the Legal Department justifiably orders parole at the conclusion of a trial or investigation.

- Warden or Head of Security may allow some possession to remain with the paroled individual during this time, at their discretion.

3. Paroled individual is to be marked in the criminal records as "Paroled".

4. Paroled individual is to be released from security.

5. Warden and Head of Security may order the paroled individual to check in at security during parole.

- Failure to comply in under 5 minutes should be considered breach of custody.
- Paroled individuals should not be required to check in more frequently than once every 15 minutes.
- Warrants are not required to search paroled individuals.

6. When their sentence is up the paroled individual should return to security to collect their belongings and be marked as discharged.
