- Any illegal chemical which requires a prescription must provide a valid prescription with the permit that is signed or stamped appropriately.

2. Review the validity and necessity of the request.

- If the item requires delivery by a department other than sec, the permit must already be signed or stamped by the relevant head.
- If the permit requires a security item that is in limited stock it my be denied until more can be obtained.
- If the requester has already received a related permit the person reviewing can choose to deny the permit unless the old permit and contraband are turned in.
- Significant Syndicate Permits are never approved.

3. If the request is not unreasonable, it is stamped APPROVED, as well as signed and stamped by the person reviewing it.

- If the request is unreasonable it is stamped DENIED instead of APPROVED.

4. A copy is made for reference and stored in warden's office.

5. The document is given to the requester. If approved they are to keep it on their person at all times. If denied they are to be given a brief explanation as to why.
