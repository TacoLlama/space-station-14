# Prisoner Treatment

1. Prisoners must be read their list of crimes before the warden before sentencing can commence. Any time spent in confinement must be subtracted from the total time of their sentence.

2. Arrested prisoners are to be searched upon entry to Security. ID's and PDA's are to be removed from prisoners while in confinement. Prisoners are to be provided/allowed their own radio communications equipment.

Prisoner searches include:
- Pockets
- PDA Slot
- Bags
- Coats/overwear

3. Prisoners placed into confinement are to be unrestrained. Prisoners who become combative or pose a flight risk may be restrained at the Warden's discretion.

4. Prisoners who receive perma/execution sentences may request a trial for their crimes, as decided by a jury of 12 of their peers. This may be waived in the face of imminent station destruction.
