# AI

[bold]These procedures relate to AI maintenance:[/bold]

1. The Captain and tge Research Director are the only staff on-board who may perform law changes to the AI.

2. No law change may occur without direct approval from both the Captain and the Research Director. All command staff must be notified prior to the law change and any objections must be discussed. Should a majority of command members vote no then no law change will be performed. Only NanoTrasen approved lawsets may be used.

3. The AI may not be placed in an intellicard unless it is clearly malfunctioning, subverted, asks to be transferred or at the end of the shift. Any member of command may place the AI into the intellicard. Once the AI has been placed into the intellicard, it should not be placed back into the console.

4. AI core turrets are to be kept lethal at all times, unless a legal law change is in progress.

5. Illegal intellicard transfer or law changes are to be met with non-lethal force. Should the action persist, lethal force may be authorized.
