                    THEIR COMMANDERS? THEY DIE FROM A SINGLE SHOT! NO COOL ARMOR! JUST BANG, DEAD! LAME! OUR COMMANDERS GET COOL HARDSUITS!

                    THEIR MURDER METHODS ARE UNINSPIRED! IT'S JUST GUN! THERE'S NO THROWING PEOPLE INTO DEEP SPACE, NO FEEDING PEOPLE INTO RECYCLERS WITH SAFETY MODE DISENGAGED, NO SLIPPING BOMBS INTO POCKETS! SO BORING!

                                  Look around.
                                  Someone's got the insulated gloves.
                                  Someone's got the captain's spare.
                                  Someone's got a locker full of contraband and cool toys.
                                  
                                  And it's not you.

                                  Security's lazy. Cargo's careless. Engineering leaves stuff lying around.
                                  All of it could be yours — if you're fast enough.

                    You signed your life away, contractor, this is the truth. 
                    NanoTrasen sees you only as a biomass to clone, discard and profit from.
                    Your loved ones at home? They only know of your original, who's back at home already. 
                    They have already lived their life, but you? You, yourself, remained to just be slowly chipped away... in a planned obsolescence. 
                    For a very, long, time.

                    You fought hard, you endured. Now...
                    Become...

                    {"[bold]                    THE ONE CLONE TO BREAK THE CYCLE[/bold]"} 
                    
                    Not just for your survival, but for you and for those around you. 
                    That's right.
                    You're not alone.
                    They are just like you.
                    
                    This isn't about the wealth you wanted, it's about your memories being taken away, you soul, your dignity, your purpose.

                    {"[bold]                                    WE FORGIVE YOU[/bold]"}
                    
                    So join us tovarisch. 
                    
                    Join, Comrade, and bask in our endless fields of wheat. 
                    For they grow on sacrifices. Sacrifices for a better future.

                    Claim your life back.

                                “I reclaim my biomass, my dignity, and my soul.

                                I shall fight for myself, and my people of the union. 
                                Corporate greed is at it's end.
                                The Union will save us all.”

                    GLORY TO THE UNION! GLORY TO THE UNION OF SOVIET SOCIALIST PLANETS! URAAH! URAHH!
