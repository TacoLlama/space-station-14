        CyberSun invented bureaucracy to sell more pens!
          
        Central Command has brainwashed monkey's working as the AI core!

        Giggles-at-Crime is a lich puppet of the Honkmother, which is capable of genetics/bioengineering. The Honkmother is not actually a god, as she is capable of influencing things outside of of here own sphere.
        She is an advanced biological entity who has reached genetic ascension!

        Quantum communication networks are being intercepted by beings from parallel dimensions!
        
        All Gorlex operatives are vegan!
        
        Virtual reality vacation packages occasionally "lose" users, transferring their consciousness to serve as processing nodes!
        
        Central Special Operations Division has a backup strategy in case NanoTrasen tells the Death Squad to kill them!

        Every SMES has a tiny hamster on a wheel!
        
        Morozov is the Holy Martyr of the old beliefs. In the "Lament of the three martyrs", Morozov is to be said to have done miracles, one of them being creating a substance to bring back the dying!

        Basalt temples or their equivalents exist on all planets sentient species developed on. The Honkmother has guided the evolution of all species, and only clowns have found enlightenment!

        The food synthesizers are programmed to include compounds that suppress revolutionary tendencies!

        "Hi vix....hod...mori meministi" I once heard this quote from a Central Intelligence Division official. This points towards "Momento Mori", which points to the inevitability of death! CID must posess information which is clearly a massive threat to the Sector itself!
    
        The Cargonia Pineapple incident is why even the mere utterenace of "Cargonia" is expressly forbidden! 1984!

        Memory backup services don't actually store your consciousness—they create copies while the original dies during transfer!
        
        Stellar Vanguard Solutions veterans initially formed the main body of opposition against the new NanoTrasen & Central Command partnership! They are the reason that Giggles-at-Crime has returned!

book-text-clown-mime-war = In the early 2300s the Trans-Solar Federation (TSF) continued to grow into the vast interstellar entity that it's founders dreamed it would be, but the disturbing discoveries about Clowns and Mimes continued to mount.
        While neither the Mothpeople or Diona had an active population of Clowns or Mimes, their historical records indicated vast Clown and Mime cults in their ancient pasts.
        With advanced scanning technology provided by the TSF, an ancient temple was unearthed buried deep under layers of basalt on the Dionae homeworld. A temple seemingly dedicated to some sort of Clown-like deity.
        Knowledge of this propagated rapidly across the TSF, with many Clowns of all species calling a vote for what to name this deity. 
        During the Gathering of the Floppy, the High Clown Giggles-At-Crimes had a seizure in the middle of the opening freestyle rap ceremony, loudly proclaiming their deity to be "The Honkmother". 
        The gathering erupted into a cacophony of honks and whoopie cushion farts that some claimed could be heard across the entire Trans-Solar Federation. 
        Absolutely nobody except the Clowns were happy with this turn of events. Everyone unanimously hated it. 
    
        Over the next 50 years the Cult of the Honkmother would grow in numbers, bolstered dramatically with each new species encountered by the Trans-Solar Federation as knowledge of their shared ancient religion spread. 
        The Arachnids, Slimes, and even Cyclorites were all found to either have an active Clown and Mime population, or to have had one in their pasts. 
        But this raised a new question, a question many feared to find the answer to now. What about the Mimes? 
        This question grew louder and louder amongst the growing Mime community, though only metaphorically.
        Everywhere that new discoveries were made, it was obvious the Mimes played some role in this strange ancient religion, but there was never any information on them to be found.
        They were simply there, a silent presence. Silence. Silence became their answer. As the Clowns grew more and more obnoxiously loud, the Mimes forged their new identity in silence. The silence to balance the noise. Or to some, as tensions increased, the silence to end the noise.
        Despite the best efforts of the Trans-Solar Federation, peace talks between the Clowns and Mimes proved fruitless for all of the reasons you would assume.
        The Mimes became increasingly galvanized by the Cult of the Honkmother's behavior, with tens of thousands flocking to take the Oath of Silence in opposition to the Clown menace, until eventually the situation broke down entirely.
        
        In 2362, the Clown-Mime Intergalactic War began. The conflict was brutal, more brutal than anyone could have anticipated.
        Several entities, supplied the Mimes with armaments and shuttles, while Cybersun secretly funded the development of the first generation of H.O.N.K Mechs, with both sides seeking to use the conflict as a proxy war of sorts.
        But neither were ready for what the Clowns unearthed. Nobody knows how, or where from, but the High Clown Giggles-At-Crimes began unleashing horrific twisted creatures upon the Mimes and soon the whole galaxy.
        Driven mad by his faith, he targeted anyone who was not a Clown. Clownspiders were hatched onboard Trans-Solar Federation stations and shuttles, and Behonkers besieged strongholds on multiple worlds.
        This caused a religious schism in the Cult of the Honkmother, as those who wished only to spread whimsy and laughter began to turn on the more radicalized followers of Giggles-At-Crimes.
        It became necessary for the Trans-Solar Federation to step in and force both sides to diplomacy.
        At the first peace summit, Giggles-At-Crimes threatened to summon a "Level 100 Gigglebeast", this was provocation enough for a Mime Assassin to shoot him through the heart three times before being detained by the TSF.
        The second peace summit was held with the more moderate followers of the Honkmother, and resulted in the restructuring of the Cult of the Honkmother.
        Hundreds of stipulations and agreements were settled within what would become known as the "Carnival Treaties", finally bringing peace to the two factions, though the scars of this conflict made relations between Clowns and Mimes troubled for a century after.

book-text-mars-incident = By the year 2100, with the immense nearly limitless funding of the Trans-Solar Federation and the technological marvels provided by NanoTrasen and Cybersun, the first permanent Mars Colonies were established. 
        These colonies focus was primarily the mining and processing of Plasma. Condensers were created that could store the Plasma in a gaseous state, which allowed them to be stored at incredibly high pressures to minimize space needed for transport back to Earth. 
        At this time, due to their large contributions to the effort, the largest mining operations were owned and run by NanoTrasen and Cybersun respectively, while ever true to their name the Trans-Solar Federation continued to branch out far into the fringes of space.
        In 2105, first contact with extraterrestrial life was made. An alien government from a neighboring solar system, the Skrellian Central Authority, became aware of Humans and made contact, which swiftly developed into an alliance. 
        A pillar of this alliance was an exchange of technology, with the SCA learning of the potency of Plasma and its many applications in exchange for the TSF being taught to create more efficient thrusters and Faster Than Light Engines. 
        In truth, these engines leveraged a previously unknown phenominon known as Bluespace, and did not violate the laws of physics as some scientists initially feared. Bluespace was more compact, and when charted precisely, could be used to vastly shorten the duration of space travel.
        With these new FTL Engines and the scientific prospects that Bluespace presented, the Trans-Solar Federation took it's first leaps into the wider galaxy. But disaster was brewing back home. 
        Despite NanoTrasen's state of the art security measures and it was inevitable that this would blow up in their face. 
        None knew just how devastating, or literal, it blowing up would be however.
    
        In 2125, NanoTrasen's Mars Mining Colony experienced a catastrophic detonation of its stored Plasma Canisters, reports from the time suggest that the disaster resulted from sabotage from the Cybersun corporation as NT prided itself on it's strict regulations and safety standards. 
        Regardless of the cause, the Mars Incident was a dark year for humanity. The detonation caused a chain reaction which detonated a deep-running Plasma vein that resulted in a massive ejection of debris and material from Mars' gravitational field. 
        Over the next year, this debris drifted into Earth's orbit, with multiple impacts devastating historical sites on the Moon, and more tragically making landfall on Earth itself. 
        These meteor showers caused massive devastation to the Siberian and Asian territories, resulting in untold tens of thousands of deaths.
