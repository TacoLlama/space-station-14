They have a fork-sword that makes you fall asleep, and they teleported you to a shuttle, and made you lay eggs! No, not alien eggs, chicken eggs! Why won't anyone believe you!? - You may choose which gland you had, but the goal is crazy alien story tone.

You know what all the Steal Objective Targets are.
